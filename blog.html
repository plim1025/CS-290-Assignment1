<h3>Assignment 1 Post</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Challenges faced in this assignment: I tried using a gitignore file to not push the image of myself to the repo, and I was initially confused because I accidentally staged it before adding the gitignore file, so I had to restore it before staging the gitignore.</li>
    <li>Oops, forgot I actually need the image file to display it in the browser. Dumb mistake by me lol.</li>
    <li>Another thing I figured out was that although I had modified the github pages website, it took a few minutes to actually deploy those changes.</li>
    <li>Things I already knew: I already knew how to write HTML, how to add an image tag, and how to add, commit, and push to a github repo.</li>
    <li>The most helpful resource for this assignment was the README of the assignment repo.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assignment 2 Post</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Challenged I faced in this assignment: Flex wrap was definitely the hardest for me. I have used flex in the past but never really got the hang of wrapping items. It took me a while to figure out that I needed to set a min-width rather than a width so the items wouldn't shrink past a certain point.</li>
    <li>Things I already knew: I knew the basics of flex, hover states, and css overall.</li>
    <li>The most helpful resource for this assignment was definitely stackoverflow. For example, when I needed to remove the default styling of the searchbox, I found on stackoverflow that all you have to do is set border to none.</li>
    <li>Overall I thought this assignment was pretty fun and got me more comfortable with flexbox.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assignment 3 Post</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Challenged I faced in this assignment: Implementing the search feature was definitely the most difficult for me, as I kept running into bugs with deleting the wrong node since when one node is deleted, it shifts the indexes of all the others.</li>
    <li>Things I already knew: I am quite comfortable with javascript since I am a frontend developer, so I knew things such as callback functions and click listeners before I finished this assignment.</li>
    <li>The most helpful resource for this assignment was definitely stackoverflow. For example, I googled how to implement the live searchbox functionality and it led be to using the onkeyup listener.</li>
    <li>Overall I thought this assignment was pretty fun and got me more comfortable with implementing searchboxes.</li>

<h3>Assignment 4 Post</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Challenged I faced in this assignment: Getting caching to work was definitely the most difficult for me. I struggled with figuring out what to memoize, and eventually figured out that the data itself in the callback function for reading files was what I needed to store in the javascript object.</li>
    <li>Things I already knew: Modules only, since I am familiar with React and ES6 imports, these came naturally to me. Other than that, I have very little backend experience, so most of this was new territory.</li>
    <li>The most helpful resource for this assignment was definitely stackoverflow. I eventually found out how to memoize the data from the callback function through this.</li>
    <li>Overall I thought this assignment was pretty interesting and definitely much different from working with the frontend.</li>
</ul>
