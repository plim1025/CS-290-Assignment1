<h3>Assignment 1 Post</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Challenges faced in this assignment: I tried using a gitignore file to not push the image of myself to the repo, and I was initially confused because I accidentally staged it before adding the gitignore file, so I had to restore it before staging the gitignore.</li>
    <li>Oops, forgot I actually need the image file to display it in the browser. Dumb mistake by me lol.</li>
    <li>Another thing I figured out was that although I had modified the github pages website, it took a few minutes to actually deploy those changes.</li>
    <li>Things I already knew: I already knew how to write HTML, how to add an image tag, and how to add, commit, and push to a github repo.</li>
    <li>The most helpful resource for this assignment was the README of the assignment repo.</li>
</ul>
